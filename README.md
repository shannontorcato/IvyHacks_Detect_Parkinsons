# IvyHacks_Detect_Parkinsons
A Web based application that takes an input image (spiral test and wave test) from the user and detects if the said user has Parkinson's or not.
In this project we use computer vision and machine learning to automatically detect Parkinson's disease based on spiral and wave test.
